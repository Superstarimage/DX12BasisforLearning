Hi human,

DX12BasisforLearning project is a short and direct project which help us to learn DX12 directly.

In this git repository, I try to add my understanding contents about DX12. And also try to package the codes to get a beautiful render core.

Here are my aims:

1. As the basic aim: know the DX12 frame solidly.

2. Project aims: Reflection, translucency, texture map, bump map, environment map, shadow, ambient occlusion in high quality.

Tough but interesting!

In order to show respect to the origin project author, I have listed his git project link.

Thanks for reading.
